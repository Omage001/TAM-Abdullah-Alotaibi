1. Project Overview

This project delivers a secure, scalable task management system that enables authenticated users to manage tasks efficiently while ensuring clean architecture, modularity, and extensibility.

The system is designed using NestJS for backend services to align with existing automation tools in the organization, ensuring consistency, reusability, and faster integration across the ecosystem.

2. Objectives

Implement secure user authentication using JWT

Provide full task lifecycle management (CRUD)

Enable filtering and searching of tasks

Support background task notifications using a message queue

Deliver a simple and functional frontend UI

Ensure clean, modular, and well-documented code

3. System Architecture
High-Level Architecture

Frontend

React (or Vue / Vanilla JS)

Communicates with backend via REST APIs

Handles authentication, task forms, filtering, and search

Backend

NestJS (Modular & scalable)

RESTful API design

JWT-based authentication

Message queue integration for background processing

Database

PostgreSQL (Relational DB)

Stores users, tasks, and metadata

Messaging Queue

Handles asynchronous processes such as task notifications

4. Technology Stack
Backend

Framework: NestJS (Node.js, TypeScript)

Authentication: JWT (Access tokens)

ORM: TypeORM or Prisma

Database: PostgreSQL

Queue: BullMQ / RabbitMQ

Validation: class-validator 
The system uses a relational database (PostgreSQL) to persist user and task data.
Below is a basic schema that supports authentication, task ownership, filtering, and search.

Documentation: Swagger (OpenAPI)

Frontend

Framework: React

State Management: React Hooks / Context

HTTP Client: Axios / Fetch API

UI: Simple responsive forms and lists

5. Functional Requirements
5.1 User Authentication

User registration

User login

Password hashing

JWT token generation and validation

Protected routes using Guards

Endpoints

POST /auth/register

POST /auth/login

5.2 Task Management

Users can:

Create tasks

Edit tasks

Delete tasks

View task list

View single task details

Task Attributes

Title

Description

Priority (Low / Medium / High)

Status (Pending / In-progress / Completed)

CreatedAt / UpdatedAt

Endpoints

POST /tasks

GET /tasks

GET /tasks/:id

PUT /tasks/:id

DELETE /tasks/:id

5.3 Filtering & Search

Filter tasks by:

Priority

Status

Search tasks by:

Title

Description 

5.4 Background Processing (Messaging Queue)

When a task is created or updated:

Publish an event to the queue

Background worker processes:

Sends notifications (email / log / webhook – extensible)

Benefits

Non-blocking API responses

Scalable async processing

Easy future extensions (reminders, scheduled jobs)

6. API Design Principles

RESTful naming conventions

Proper HTTP status codes

DTO-based validation

Controller → Service → Repository separation

Centralized error handling

Swagger auto-generated documentation

7. Frontend Features

Authentication forms (Register / Login)

Task creation and edit forms

Task list with:

Filters (status, priority)

Search bar

Clear user feedback (loading, success, errors)

8. Database Design (Simplified)
User Table

id

email

password

created_at

Task Table

id

title

description

priority

status

user_id (FK)

created_at

updated_at

9. Code Quality & Best Practices

Modular NestJS structure

Reusable services and guards

Clear naming conventions

Environment-based configuration

Centralized logging

Unit-ready architecture (testable services) 

11. Deliverables

Fully functional NestJS backend

REST API with Swagger documentation

PostgreSQL database schema

Message queue worker

Simple frontend UI
